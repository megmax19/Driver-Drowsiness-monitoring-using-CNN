# Driver-Drowsiness-monitoring-using-CNN
The purpose of this project is to develop an advanced driver drowsiness detection system that leverages computer vision and machine learning to enhance road safety. Fatigue and drowsiness at the wheel are major contributors to road accidents, accounting for approximately 20% of fatal crashes worldwide. Traditional methods of detecting driver fatigue often rely on intrusive sensors or lack the robustness needed for real-world conditions. This project aims to create a non-intrusive, real-time monitoring system that can accurately identify signs of drowsiness and alert drivers before accidents occur.

By utilizing a simple webcam and sophisticated algorithms, the system will continuously analyze the driver's facial features, including eye closure rate, blink frequency, yawning, and head movements. The approach combines Haar cascade classifiers for efficient face detection with a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify eye states with high precision. Key metrics such as Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and Percentage of Eye Closure (PERCLOS) will be used to ensure reliable drowsiness detection. The system will be designed to work under varying lighting conditions and across different facial structures, making it adaptable for diverse users.

The ultimate goal is to reduce fatigue-related accidents by providing timely alerts to drowsy drivers. The system will integrate audible, visual, or haptic warnings to prompt the driver to take corrective action, such as taking a break. Beyond individual safety, this technology has the potential to be integrated into commercial vehicles, fleet management systems, and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), contributing to broader road safety initiatives. By combining real-time processing with high accuracy, this project aims to set a new standard for proactive driver fatigue detection systems.
